### What I learned

What I learned

In my case I already had previous knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS, even so with this level I achieved a better understanding of the requests that a web page makes when loading, as well as I learned things that I did not know such as the "single page" approach to while achieving a better understanding of the developer tools.
